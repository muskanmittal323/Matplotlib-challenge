# Matplotlib-challenge


Welcome to the Pymaceuticals Analysis Project! This repository houses the detailed analysis of Pymaceuticals Inc.'s recent animal study, focusing on the evaluation of anti-cancer pharmaceuticals for treating squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The objective is to provide comprehensive insights into the efficacy of various drug regimens, particularly the company's frontrunner drug, Capomulin, in reducing tumor growth in mice. Our analysis aims to equip Pymaceuticals' executive team with data-driven findings to inform strategic decisions in their ongoing cancer research endeavors.



# Structure

- The challenge has its own folder (Pymaceuticals) with the following files:
  - A .ipynb file: Jupiter Notebook Report for analysis.
  - A data Folder: Contains the two datasets to be analysed:
    - Mouse_metadata.csv: Contains the metadata for each mouse.
    - Study_results.csv: Contains the results of the study including the tumor volume measurements.


# Execution

The project is executed in a Jupyter notebook, which includes data loading, aggregation, analysis, and visualization steps. The notebook is designed to be user-friendly, with clear comments and instructions throughout.
